# Advent of Code 2016

I can't hardly wait for Christmas, but this [calendar](http://adventofcode.com/2016) helps a little bit.

I hate to see any spoilers before I start coding, but afterwards it is fun to see how people came up with different solutions for the same puzzle, and even when the puzzles are rather simple, there are a lot of ways to code them. So here are my contributions. Remember, don't look at them before you finish your own solutions!
